# **Internship Milestone Project: Learning Management System (LMS)**  

## **Project Overview**  
During my internship, I developed a **Learning Management System (LMS)** designed to streamline **education management** for teachers, students, and administrators. The platform features **three separate dashboards**, each tailored to a specific user role, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders.  

## **Key Features & Functionalities**  

### ✅ **👩‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard:**  
- Upload and manage **assignments** for students.  
- Track and **update student attendance** in real time.  
- View and assess **submitted student assignments**.  

### ✅ **🎓 Student Dashboard:**  
- **View and submit assignments** directly from the dashboard.  
- Check **attendance records** and progress reports.  
- Access **learning materials** and announcements from teachers.  

### ✅ **👨‍💼 Admin Dashboard:**  
- Manage **teachers and students**, including **role-based access**.  
- Monitor **assignment submissions and attendance records**.  
- Oversee overall **performance and engagement metrics**.  

## **Tech Stack & Implementation**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive and responsive UI.  
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database, and Storage) for real-time updates and data handling.  
- **User Authentication:** Secure login system using Firebase Auth for **teachers, students, and admins**.  

## **Project Impact**  
This LMS enhances **learning efficiency, assignment tracking, and student engagement** by providing an organized digital space for education. It simplifies administrative processes while allowing teachers to focus more on teaching rather than manual tracking.  

🚀 This project strengthened my skills in **full-stack development, database management, and user experience design**, while also deepening my understanding of **role-based application logic**.
